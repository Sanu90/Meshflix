# React + Vite Netflix Clone

This project is a small Netflix clone built using React and Vite. It allows users to view trending movies, original series, action, comedy, and more. Users can click on movie images to watch trailers if they are available on YouTube.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
